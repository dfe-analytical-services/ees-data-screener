# Govdown

::: {.lead-para}
Govdown is an R package for creating websites and standalone HTML pages that use
the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).  This website
is an example.
:::

Use govdown in the same way as [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),
but specify `output: govdown::govdown_document` instead of `output:
html_document` in the YAML metadata of the document, or in the `_site.yml` file
of the website.

```{r}
## Pass a vector to sum, and it will add the elements together.
sum(1:5)

## Pass several numbers to sum, and it also adds the elements.
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

## In fact, you can pass vectors into several arguments, and everything gets added.
sum(1:2, 3:5)

## If there are missing values, the sum is unknown, i.e., also missing, ....
sum(1:5, NA)
## ... unless  we exclude missing values explicitly:
sum(1:5, NA, na.rm = TRUE)
```

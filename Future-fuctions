# Functions to create
Something that counts and outputs the maximum character lengths per column - more of a style guide to consider later
Anything on school level data that isn't already covered (thinking geographic levels etc)
Something checking if the geographic codes are relevant to the year of data - a very optimistic and complex one
Adding something to flag if columns such as time or geography are in the metadata and give a message that they shouldn't be
Checks that check if indicators have a certain unit, they are a specific type? Might not be needed nor possible


# Very possible
Extract the indicator groupings and print
add a message for filters where a hint isn't added so that we can say 'you don't have a hint for x, are you sure?
